# BitMash

An open-source gamejam-style project inspired by something I can't find on the internet at the moment but hey it's git so I can add that later probably. The point is, the game looks like garbage in screenshots and only makes sense in motion.

It used to be Bit-Thrash, now it's BitMash. Deal with it.
