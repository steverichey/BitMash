# BitMash

An open-source gamejam-style project inspired by both something I randomly did while working on OpenGNOP and Sean Howard's White Noise.  The point is, the game looks like garbage in screenshots and only makes sense in motion.

The original prototype was made in about an hour. Just about everything in the game was implemented (badly) in under a day. Then I spent some time playing with the mechanics and making levels and stuff.

Oh, and it used to be Bit-Thrash, now it's BitMash. Deal with it.
